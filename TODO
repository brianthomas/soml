= Make the serializations of instances/objects 
  match RDF as closely as possible (this will break loading
  handlers from schema in XSSP package) 
  Presently only rdf:type is part of the package. Think about
  rdfs:label as well..

= Pick over the support interfaces (SOMLDocument/SOMLElement) to be sure
we dont include methods we dont need .
