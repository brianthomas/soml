SOML Package Overview. 
<p>
SOML (Semantic Object Model Language) Java package provides 
handy representations of (instances of) semantic objects.
Representations of SO in Java and XML are provided to aid
in computing and storage. This package is (hopefully) designed 
in a manner which allows easy mapping to and from ontology 
instances (e.g. OWL/RDF).
